# Molotov
## DoS your own server

---
# Foreword

![Tarek Ziadé](images/tarek-ziade.jpg)

* Written by Tarek Ziadé
* documentation: https://molotov.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
* repository: https://github.com/loads/molotov

---
# Context

* You will deploy a new server or a new version of a server
* You want to know how many requests per minute it can serve without problems

---
# Write small scenarios in Python 3

.smaller[
```python
@scenario(1)
async def shorten_and_expand(session):
    short_url = await shorten(session)
    long_url = await expand(session, short_url)
    assert long_url == _LONG_URL

async def shorten(session):
    input = dict(longUrl=_LONG_URL)
    async with session.post(_API + '/shorten', json=input) as resp:
        assert resp.status == 200
        res = await resp.json()

    short_url = res['shortUrl']
    return short_url
```
]

Notice:
* asynchronous
* assertions

---
# Several scenarios in one file, with weights

.smaller[
```python
# Each scenario has a weight. Molotov uses it to determine how often the
# scenario is picked.
@scenario(1)
async def publish_and_delete(session):
    jwt_token = await publish(session=session, data_size=512)
    await delete(session=session, jwt_token=jwt_token)


@scenario(2)
async def publish_512(session):
    await publish(session=session, data_size=512)
```
]

They'll run concurrently.

---
# Run it!

Run only one scenario in one file:

.smaller[
```
molotov --max-runs 1 --single-mode <name of scenario> -v publish.py
```
]

To run the scenarios during 5 seconds, with 50 workers, this is how we can do it:
.smaller[
```
molotov -d 5 -w 50 -v publish.py
```
]
---
# Autosizing!


To let molotov do its magic and run all tests in a file, this is how we run it:
```
$ molotov --sizing publish.py
***** Molotov v2.0. Happy breaking! ****
We'll run tests against the endpoint http://localhost:5252.
Preparing 500 workers...
OK
SUCCESSES: 4665 | FAILURES: 0 | WORKERS: 151
Sizing is over!

Error Ratio 5.09 % obtained with 0 workers.

OVERALL: SUCCESSES: 4814 | FAILURES: 46
LAST MINUTE: SUCCESSES: 1032 | FAILURES: 46

**** Bye ***
```

# Tips and tricks

* use virtualenv
* Be careful to your limiting factor
  .smaller[* In my case it was my own bandwidth]
* To increase the load you can make a docker that runs the test and run one or
several instances in the CLOUD.
* use "real packages" and not "file packages" (sorry for the bad Python
terminology)
